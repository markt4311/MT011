MT011_SPI_WIZNET_panel_v1_gerber.zip, is a 102 x 100 mm panel of two 51 x 100 mm boards, separated by v-score, this file set has been manufactured by JLCPCB tested. JLCPCB may now be charging extra for boards panelised with v-score.

MT011_SPI_WIZNET_v1_gerber.zip, is a single 51 x 100 mm board, based on the same Eagle design files as the panel, but has not yet been manufactured or tested.

Note the extra 1 mm width of the board compared to standard RC2014 module size extends the bus connector edge of the board. I find this helps positioning the right angled pin header and does not change the height of the module as fitted to the backplane.
